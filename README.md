This mechanism is to setup a theoretical framework for explaining the self-maintaining and self-amplifying of gravity-wave-mode (GWM) disturbances.\\
With constructing a toy model, this study shows several key results:\\
1. Gravity-wave-mode disturbances can be simulated by only the first two vertical modes.
2. 2nd-mode temperature profile and mid-tropospheric moisture deficit are important in the GWM growth.\\
